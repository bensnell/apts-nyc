It has been my husband and I's happy home for the last seven years. The only reason we're leaving is because we have a baby on the way and need more space. We particularly love how quiet it is, the layout of the kitchen and eating space, the spacious bedroom which could be converted into a half living space/half bedroom, and how well-maintained the apartment and building are.

Sad to leave because this is a really great rent-controlled apartment I've been in for the last 4 years. Its way under the neighborhood average price and right on Orchard Street at Canal. Several residents are young professionals who've lived here 5-10 years. Apartment will be available Feb 1 but can likely get you in several days early if needed. Landlord lives in Queens and is great. <br><br>Apartment has a small bedroom, large kitchen, large living room, and small bathroom. One weird thing is the shower is in the kitchen (not as weird as it sounds, its kinda well hidden). There's no closets but I've purchased one of the custom Ikea Wardrobes for around $800 1.5 years ago that I can leave if wanted for a small price.<br><br>No brokers fee. Landlord will want a 1 month deposit. We can prorate if you want to move in January. Must have proof of income. <br><br><br><br>    	LowerEast_F_BD

We are only leaving because we have a baby on the way and need more space. <br><br>Some of our favorite aspects of the apartment are: how quiet it is, the layout of the kitchen is great and has room for a table or office area, management is super responsive to any requests needed, sizeable bedroom that could be divided into half bedroom/half living space. <br><br>Laundry is on the block (private for the tenants). This is a walk-up, 5th floor - 4 flights of stairs. The stairs are quite manageable as they wind around - you only go up about 8 steps before there's a landing and you wind around. <br><br>Trash chutes on every floor. Recycling in the lobby of the building. <br><br>Fantastic restaurants and grocery stores around and steps away from Carl Schurz Park!    	LowerUpperEast_6_NQ

They have required paper work, collect security etc. I run a business in Westchester and the commute has just become too much. I love my little apartment but I hardly am there anymore. <br><br>Here is a little bit about the apartment: <br><br>- Located on 81st Street between 2nd and 3rd - so many great restaurants and stores just steps from the apartment. To the East is the East River and Carl Shurz Park + running esplanade, and to the West is Central Park, The Met and Madison Avenue. With-in blocks to 4-5-6-Q trains. Wholefoods (my fave) is 5 blocks away. Entrance onto FDR takes minutes. <br>- Small Kitchen over looking the Living Room (this was a selling point for me) I like the flow of that. There is room for a small table and two chairs in the kitchen area in front of a window - not a view window but it looks nice :)<br>- GREAT LIGHTING + WINDOWS the Living Room has wonderful lighting, when I moved in I was working from home a lot so this was a huge deal for me, I love the big windows and sun. <br>- Small but functional kitchen - Counter Fridge, Full Gas Range and Oven, Large Micro and Sink. Decent cabinet space.<br>- Bedroom is small. I am able to fit my full bed and dresser. 1 Closet with storage space above. Luckily us New Yorkers don't spend a lot of time in our bedrooms :) <br>- Bathroom is in great condition and functional layout. Bathtub/Shower. Big Mirror. Great Lighting. <br>- Extra Storage Closet in Hallway Next to doorway to Apt. This has come in huge, I keep bins of off season clothes, cleaning supplies, travel luggage etc. <br>- This is a no elevator building - so there are 3 flights of stairs, but that has also been my excuse not to go to the gym :)  Its actually not so bad. <br>- I always find parking on or near my street. <br>- Laundry Mat right under our building. Great people. <br>- Overall - I love the building, its in great condition (new windows, polished floors, clean appliances etc), attentive super and management office, quiet (!) neighbors, so close to subways, restaurants, shops etc. <br><br>Serious inquiries only. Looking for someone to start 2/15, 3/1 or 3/15 <br>Happy to show apartment to those who are seriously considering.    	Yorkville_UpperUpperEast_NQ_456

Owner is a semi-retired feminist lawyer who lives on the ground and parlor floors. She responds quickly to issues. There are three rental apartments upstairs. Animals are permitted on a case-by-case basis (there's a sweet dog living on the top floor). There is FREE WiFi for the whole building. There is no laundry available, but laundromat closeby. Heat and hot water provided. Gas (for stove) and electric are tenant's responsibilities. <br><br>THE APARTMENT: The apartment is a small one-bedroom. It is up two flights of stairs (one outside, one inside).    <br><br>THE LIVING ROOM: There is a spacious living room with big windows facing the street that let in good light. It has an exposed brick wall with an unusable but adorable fireplace.<br><br>THE KITCHEN: There is a full size kitchen with new stove and fridge. Can fit a dining table and actually sit down to eat. Has a large closet/pantry. Window overlooks the backyard. Note: Pictures show a dryer under the kitchen table, but there is no washer/dryer hookup.   <br><br>THE BATHROOM: The bathroom is decent sized. It has a full tub and shower. Original tiling.<br><br>THE BEDROOM: The bedroom is small. It is an actual bedroom (this is not a studio) but is long and thin. It fits a full size bed on risers, as well as some space for one large or two small dressers. The bedroom has its own window with a nice view. There is some noise in the morning once or twice a week when the garbage collectors come around. <br><br>FURNITURE: Some of the furniture can be purchased from the outgoing tenant if desired.<br><br>INTERESTED?

Apartment is located in the glorious neighborhood of Yorkville on the Upper East Side. Monthly rent is $1850. The past two re-signings, the rent only increased by $25.<br><br>1 bed/1 bath. It is on the fifth floor of a five story walk up. No doorman, no laundry in building, no dishwasher, but the space itself is really wonderful. Good neighbors, great location for someone who wants a little peace and quiet in their area, while still having access to local bars/restaurants/shops. The Q is two avenue's over, or a 5-10 minute walking, depending on how late you're running. Really wish I didn't need to move, because I could stay here forever.<br><br>Requires credit check and security + first &amp; last month's rent. Landlord usually goes through a broker to rent these units, so a great opportunity to rent without a fee of 15% of the annual rent, about $3,000 that I'll never see again.<br><br>Here are pics: <br>https://imgur.com/a/1eOMF9s    	Yorkville_UpperUpperEast_NQ_456
