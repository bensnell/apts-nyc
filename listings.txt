It has been my husband and I's happy home for the last seven years. The only reason we're leaving is because we have a baby on the way and need more space. We particularly love how quiet it is, the layout of the kitchen and eating space, the spacious bedroom which could be converted into a half living space/half bedroom, and how well-maintained the apartment and building are.

Sad to leave because this is a really great rent-controlled apartment I've been in for the last 4 years. Its way under the neighborhood average price and right on Orchard Street at Canal. Several residents are young professionals who've lived here 5-10 years. Apartment will be available Feb 1 but can likely get you in several days early if needed. Landlord lives in Queens and is great. <br><br>Apartment has a small bedroom, large kitchen, large living room, and small bathroom. One weird thing is the shower is in the kitchen (not as weird as it sounds, its kinda well hidden). There's no closets but I've purchased one of the custom Ikea Wardrobes for around $800 1.5 years ago that I can leave if wanted for a small price.<br><br>No brokers fee. Landlord will want a 1 month deposit. We can prorate if you want to move in January. Must have proof of income. <br><br><br><br>    	LowerEast_F_BD

We are only leaving because we have a baby on the way and need more space. <br><br>Some of our favorite aspects of the apartment are: how quiet it is, the layout of the kitchen is great and has room for a table or office area, management is super responsive to any requests needed, sizeable bedroom that could be divided into half bedroom/half living space. <br><br>Laundry is on the block (private for the tenants). This is a walk-up, 5th floor - 4 flights of stairs. The stairs are quite manageable as they wind around - you only go up about 8 steps before there's a landing and you wind around. <br><br>Trash chutes on every floor. Recycling in the lobby of the building. <br><br>Fantastic restaurants and grocery stores around and steps away from Carl Schurz Park!    	LowerUpperEast_6_NQ
