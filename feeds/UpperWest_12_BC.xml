Both are hard-working, neat, and respectful of the common areas.  None of us knew each other when we moved in, but we've settled on a good mix of both some shared things (we'll share meals from time to time) and privacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The outgoing roommate is leaving the city for a new job but is disappointed to be leaving this apartment.  We're looking for an easy-going, non-smoking, respectful young professional - in your response, please tell us a little about yourself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Cheers!    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_hhAUMA8woYA_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_i7SQHmldesd_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_l2aaJwuixXJ_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/01111_7ykbz1NKw5R_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00404_bSUVXwZMbUN_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/01010_9InKQ1xvhL4_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00g0g_ibxySoUk8DB_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00P0P_egOd2TDOngp_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-room-for-rent-in-spacious/6797486052.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-17T16:41:00-05:00</published></entry></feed>
