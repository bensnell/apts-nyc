We are only leaving because we have a baby on the way and need more space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of our favorite aspects of the apartment are: how quiet it is, the layout of the kitchen is great and has room for a table or office area, management is super responsive to any requests needed, sizeable bedroom that could be divided into half bedroom/half living space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laundry is on the block (private for the tenants). This is a walk-up, 5th floor - 4 flights of stairs. The stairs are quite manageable as they wind around - you only go up about 8 steps before there's a landing and you wind around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trash chutes on every floor. Recycling in the lobby of the building. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fantastic restaurants and grocery stores around and steps away from Carl Schurz Park!    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_a7uwtWT193T_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00404_7mmrN2uiv3n_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00707_jGScFuxFNKa_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00c0c_lLcwYwteQix_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/01111_avkwaD04d68_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00y0y_bG4kvn8fsn_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-clean-junior-1-bedroom-on/6793827746.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-13T11:17:00-05:00</published></entry></feed>
