You will start a new lease with the management company when you move in, so be prepared with bank statements, paystubs, current tax return, and proof of employment. I actually replaced someone else when I moved in and the transition process is easy and seamless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have lived in this apartment for 2.5 years and love it. It's a bargain for the area &amp;amp; the state of the apartment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THE APARTMENT:&lt;br&gt;- True one bedroom in the heart of the Lower East Side &lt;br&gt;- Large bedroom that fits a queen sized bed&lt;br&gt;- Modern furnishes, building recently renovated&lt;br&gt;- Approximately 450 square feet&lt;br&gt;- LOTS of closet space &lt;br&gt;- Fourth floor walk up &lt;br&gt;- Cat-friendly&lt;br&gt;- Full size bathroom (huge bathtub!)&lt;br&gt;- One block from the F train and M-15 SBS&lt;br&gt;- In the middle of all the action! Steps from Katz's, Sweet Chick, The Meatball Shop, Pianos, Kind Regards, 4 ramen shops, you name it&lt;br&gt;- Run by a management company who is really on top of it - if you call with a maintenance request, they come the same day&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are looking for someone to move in on September 15th, but we are flexible with move-in date. I will be showing the apartment. Please email me with a suggested date and time that you would like to see the space! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: If you found this apartment on your own, you'd expect to pay a hefty brokers fee. There is a "lease transfer fee" but it's a small fraction of what the brokers fee would be.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00505_jMEH2kpou4r_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00T0T_7psjzeup02V_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_nfugAEw5Ez_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/01616_iVmc4fsWW51_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00202_fIcnJFS6sPB_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00K0K_jdFHmSC7dPq_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/2495-1br-quiet-sunny-1/6664648685.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-08-07T14:53:00-05:00</published></entry></feed>
