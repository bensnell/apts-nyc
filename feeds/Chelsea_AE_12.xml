I am looking for someone to take over my portion of the lease. If you love the place and want to stay you will have the option to extend the lease after the 4 months are up. $2,200 a month plus utilities and Wi-FI. There's laundry in the building and an elevator to the 4th floor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The building is located in between Meatpacking district and Chelsea. It's a 1 minute walk from the L train.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prime location surrounded by lots of great restaurants, bars, and Chelsea Market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Current roommate is a 32 year old product designer at SoulCycle. Super clean, easy going, and doesn't party on the weekends. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Message me if you're interested.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_ebnopXgnAUs_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_3jDo5RUAfq4_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00d0d_3IwpTP23wX9_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00x0x_f0LqkgeKDSO_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00i0i_dCzVJNllRyc_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_hhcC7thE243_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-citybr-room-in-2-bedroom/6805527112.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-27T21:45:00-05:00</published></entry></feed>
