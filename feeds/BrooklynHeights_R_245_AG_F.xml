The lease goes until July 2019 with an option to renew. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Building:&lt;br&gt;The building has coin-operated laundry, a small gym, a small BBQ deck and a front desk attendant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apartment:&lt;br&gt;The apartment has two bedrooms and two bathrooms, a kitchen with a bar that looks into the living area. There are two closets in the common area. The living area has a TV and couch and the kitchen has cooking utensils, plates, glasses and mugs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Room:&lt;br&gt;Your bedroom (the one with the alcove in the floor plan) would easily fit a queen bed with lots of room to spare. I may be willing to leave the bed/mattress and a dresser if that helps your decision. The bed is a queen. The room also has a wide closet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Roommate:&lt;br&gt;Your roommate is a whimsical and thoughtful 28 year old guy who works at a Fin Tech company in FiDi. He tends to be pretty clean and quiet, but is always down to watch a movie or chat. He has been a pleasure to live with! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am willing to negotiate both move-in date and rent! Let me know if you have any questions.&lt;br&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00S0S_lhJyNTgNzYX_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00l0l_dqiWaPrZDcd_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00F0F_br5bZT2xzqB_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00202_6w7JtTPYRFw_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_ilfFoXTvPXf_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00z0z_2jfFoC3fBaw_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/nfb/d/brooklynbr-one-room-for-rent-in-2/6793632971.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-12T20:26:00-05:00</published></entry></feed>
