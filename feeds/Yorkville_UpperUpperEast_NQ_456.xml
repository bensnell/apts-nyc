They have required paper work, collect security etc. I run a business in Westchester and the commute has just become too much. I love my little apartment but I hardly am there anymore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is a little bit about the apartment: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Located on 81st Street between 2nd and 3rd - so many great restaurants and stores just steps from the apartment. To the East is the East River and Carl Shurz Park + running esplanade, and to the West is Central Park, The Met and Madison Avenue. With-in blocks to 4-5-6-Q trains. Wholefoods (my fave) is 5 blocks away. Entrance onto FDR takes minutes. &lt;br&gt;- Small Kitchen over looking the Living Room (this was a selling point for me) I like the flow of that. There is room for a small table and two chairs in the kitchen area in front of a window - not a view window but it looks nice :)&lt;br&gt;- GREAT LIGHTING + WINDOWS the Living Room has wonderful lighting, when I moved in I was working from home a lot so this was a huge deal for me, I love the big windows and sun. &lt;br&gt;- Small but functional kitchen - Counter Fridge, Full Gas Range and Oven, Large Micro and Sink. Decent cabinet space.&lt;br&gt;- Bedroom is small. I am able to fit my full bed and dresser. 1 Closet with storage space above. Luckily us New Yorkers don't spend a lot of time in our bedrooms :) &lt;br&gt;- Bathroom is in great condition and functional layout. Bathtub/Shower. Big Mirror. Great Lighting. &lt;br&gt;- Extra Storage Closet in Hallway Next to doorway to Apt. This has come in huge, I keep bins of off season clothes, cleaning supplies, travel luggage etc. &lt;br&gt;- This is a no elevator building - so there are 3 flights of stairs, but that has also been my excuse not to go to the gym :)  Its actually not so bad. &lt;br&gt;- I always find parking on or near my street. &lt;br&gt;- Laundry Mat right under our building. Great people. &lt;br&gt;- Overall - I love the building, its in great condition (new windows, polished floors, clean appliances etc), attentive super and management office, quiet (!) neighbors, so close to subways, restaurants, shops etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Serious inquiries only. Looking for someone to start 2/15, 3/1 or 3/15 &lt;br&gt;Happy to show apartment to those who are seriously considering.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00n0n_2ZRTtio7sSX_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00h0h_jaW0K8wM6kn_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00o0o_sx3KterWjC_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_5r1ui4Og6qJ_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-charming-1br-located-in/6794991575.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-14T18:57:00-05:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-large-bright-1br-great/6795072367.html</id><title>$2495  //  Large Bright 1BR w great private outdoor space in a beautiful bldg!</title><updated>2019-01-14T19:07:00-05:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00V0V_8OLkknHk7Pl_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dishwasher&lt;br&gt;Laundry in Building&lt;br&gt;Microwave&lt;br&gt;Private Outdoor Space&lt;br&gt;Pets Allowed&lt;br&gt;Hardwood Floors&lt;br&gt;Brand New Unit W/Stainless Steel Kitchen&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please feel free to contact me w any questions at nine two nine two two eight five five zero two    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00p0p_hRfBFCONiGG_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00m0m_4Bgme0bqCrm_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00u0u_qfLSscg9M0_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00808_fonAZlhvnvn_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-large-bright-1br-great/6795072367.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-14T19:07:00-05:00</published></entry><entry><id>https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-large-bright-1br-lots-of/6795086891.html</id><title>$2395  //  Large Bright 1BR w lots of closets space in a beautiful bldg!</title><updated>2019-01-14T19:21:00-05:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00f0f_iMtafYaorhm_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Please contact me at nine two nine two two eight five five zero two    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00J0J_9OtPK74G5Ge_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00q0q_45nQat8OmOf_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00I0I_gq5QE9fwxhf_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00v0v_ddsCeo3DWGj_600x450.jpg" /&gt; &lt;img src="https://images.craigslist.org/00k0k_jhD8x930u6Z_600x450.jpg" /&gt; </content><link href="https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/d/new-york-city-large-bright-1br-lots-of/6795086891.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2019-01-14T19:21:00-05:00</published></entry></feed>
